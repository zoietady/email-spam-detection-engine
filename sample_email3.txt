Dear Zoie Joseph,

I am writing to update you on a new development in relation to the current cyber incident.

What we know
Earlier today, we received messages from a group who claim to have removed customer data. We are working urgently to establish if the claim is true, although based on our ongoing forensic investigation we are treating the matter seriously at this time.

I understand that this may cause you some concern, and I apologise. I want to assure you that the protection of your data remains our priority.

Our systems have not been encrypted by ransomware, which means usual activities for customers continue. However, our ongoing response to safeguard our networks and systems may require necessary temporary disruptions to our services.

How we will communicate
We will continue to keep you informed with any new information.

As we have done throughout this incident, we will also post regularly to the information page on our website.

As always, Medibank or ahm will never contact you requesting your passwords or other sensitive information.

Thank you for your understanding and patience as we work through this incident. http http http http http http http http
